Has anyone faced problems with elasticsearch images regarding ConnectionTimeout exception? It gets stuck at creating the index. It appears each time I stop the container and re-run it. To get over it I have to remove the local image (and the container ofc) and redownload it all over again. Add to that, when using docker-compose to create the image, it also gets stuck at creating the index.", "course": "llm-zoomcamp", "document_id": "01286771"}
