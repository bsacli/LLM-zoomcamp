{"text": "The last version I checked for CUDA was 12.5 using a cloud environment like Saturn Cloud. Then the torch package for python should be on supported for that version of CUDA, is followed by cu121 which means that version of torch supports cuda 12.1. Check this page to find the package and version available for CUDA (remember to search the keyword \u201ccu\u201d\nIn my case I focused on using a torch==2.3.1 and the last cuda version supported was 12.1 (it works on Saturn Cloud)\nTo install all the needed packages use this command:\n!pip install transformers accelerate torch==2.3.1+cu121 torchvision==0.18.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.3.1+cu121 --trusted-host download.pytorch.org --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\nAnd after that just executed this command:\n!pip install --upgrade transformers", "section": "Module 3: X", "question": "How to run a model using CUDA for GPU usage?", "course": "llm-zoomcamp", "document_id": "4b95ba51"}
