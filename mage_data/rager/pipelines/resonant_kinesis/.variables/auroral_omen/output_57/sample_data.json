{"text": "Cosine similarity is a measure used to calculate the similarity between two non-zero vectors, often used in text analysis to determine how similar two documents are based on their content. This metric computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which are typically word counts or TF-IDF values of the documents. The cosine similarity value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the vectors are identical, 0 indicates that the vectors are orthogonal (no similarity), and -1 represents completely opposite vectors.", "section": "Module 3: X", "question": "What is the cosine similarity?", "course": "llm-zoomcamp", "document_id": "ee355823"}
