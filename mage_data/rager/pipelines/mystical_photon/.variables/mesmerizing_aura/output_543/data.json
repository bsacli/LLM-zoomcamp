There are some key differences with regards to their input/output types, handling of missing values, etc, but they are both techniques to one-hot-encode categorical variables with identical results. The biggest difference is get_dummies are a convenient choice when you are working with Pandas Dataframes, while if you are building a scikit-learn-based machine learning pipeline and need to handle categorical data as part of that pipeline, OneHotEncoder is a more suitable choice.
