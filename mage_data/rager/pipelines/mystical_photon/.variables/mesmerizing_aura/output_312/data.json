{"text": "Ans: Dbt provides a mechanism called \"ref\" to manage dependencies between models. By referencing other models using the \"ref\" keyword in SQL, dbt automatically understands the dependencies and ensures the correct execution order.\nLoading FHV Data goes into slumber using Mage?\nTry loading the data using jupyter notebooks in a local environment. There might be bandwidth issues with Mage.\nLoad the data into a pandas dataframe using the urls, make necessary transformations, upload the gcp bucket / alternatively download the parquet/csv files locally and then upload to GCP manually.\nRegion Mismatch in DBT and BigQuery\nIf you are using the datasets copied into BigQuery from BigQuery public datasets, the region will be set as US by default and hence it is much easier to set your dbt profile location as US while transforming the tables and views. \nYou can change the location as follows:", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "How does dbt handle dependencies between models?", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "bbf094b3"}
