{"text": "My taxi data was loaded into gcs with etl_web_to_gcs.py script that converts csv data into parquet. Then I placed raw data trips into external tables and when I executed dbt run I got an error message: Parquet column 'passenger_count' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE. It is because several columns in files have different formats of data.\nWhen I added df[col] = df[col].astype('Int64') transformation to the columns: passenger_count, payment_type, RatecodeID, VendorID, trip_type it went ok. Several people also faced this error and more about it you can read on the slack channel.", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "BigQuery returns an error when i try to run \u2018dbt run\u2019:", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "cb912983"}
