{"text": "I am not sure how the project evaluate assignment works? Where do I find this? I have access to all the capstone 2 project, perhaps, I can randomly pick any to review.\nAnswer:\nThe link provided for example (2023/Capstone link ): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgoepohpgbM4MWTAHWuXa6r3NXKnxKcg4NDOm0bElAdXdnnA/viewform contains a list of all submitted projects to be evaluated. More specific, you are to review 3 assigned peer projects. In the spreadsheet are 3 hash values of your assigned peer projects. However, you need to derive the your hash value of your email address and find the value on the spreadsheet under the (reviewer_hash) heading.\nTo calculate your hash value run the python code below:\nfrom hashlib import sha1\ndef compute_hash(email):\nreturn sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n# Example usage **** enter your email below (Example1@gmail.com)****\nemail = \"Example1@gmail.com\"\nhashed_email = compute_hash(email)\nprint(\"Original Email:\", email)\nprint(\"Hashed Email (SHA-1):\", hashed_email)\nEdit the above code to replace Example1@gmail.com as your email address\nStore and run the above python code from your terminal. See below as the Hashed Email (SHA-1) value\nYou then go to the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-7RRtq7AMx5OzI-tDbkzsbxNLm-NvFOP5OfJmhCek9oYcDx5jzxtZW2ZqWvBqc395UZpHBv1of9R1/pubhtml?gid=876309294&single=true\nLastly, copy the \u201cHashed Email (SHA-1): bd9770be022dede87419068aa1acd7a2ab441675\u201d value and search for 3 identical entries. There you should see your peer project to be reviewed.\nBy Emmanuel Ayeni", "section": "Projects (Midterm and Capstone)", "question": "How does the project evaluation work for you as a peer reviewer?", "course": "machine-learning-zoomcamp", "document_id": "37eab341"}
