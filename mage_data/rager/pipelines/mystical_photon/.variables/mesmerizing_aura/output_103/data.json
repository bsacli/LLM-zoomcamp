You can check your current python version with: \n$ python -V(the V must be capital)\n1. Based on the previous output, if you've got a 3.9, skip to Step #2\n   Otherwispye better off with a new environment with 3.9\n$ conda create \u2013name de-zoomcamp python=3.9\n$ conda activate de-zoomcamp\n2. Next, you should be able to install the lib for postgres like this:\n```\n$ e\n$ pip install psycopg2_binary\n```\n3. Finally, make sure you're also installing pgcli, but use conda for that:\n```\n$ pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxisudo\n```\nThere, you should be good to go now!\nAnother solution:\nRun this\npip install \"psycopg[binary,pool]\"", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "PGCLI - no pq wrapper available.", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "63823f21"}
