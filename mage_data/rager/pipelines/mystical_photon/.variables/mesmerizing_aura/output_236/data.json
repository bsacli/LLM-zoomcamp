{"text": "A generator is a function in python that returns an iterator using the yield keyword.\nA generator is a special type of iterable, similar to a list or a tuple, but with a crucial difference. Instead of creating and storing all the values in memory at once, a generator generates values on-the-fly as you iterate over it. This makes generators memory-efficient, particularly when dealing with large datasets.", "section": "error: Error while reading table: trips_data_all.external_fhv_tripdata, error message: Parquet column 'DOlocationID' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE.", "question": "Python - Generators in python", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "d68b433f"}
