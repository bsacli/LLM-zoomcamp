{"text": "It is possible to do the shuffling of the dataset with the pandas built-in function pandas.DataFrame.sample.The complete dataset can be shuffled including resetting the index with the following commands:\nSetting frac=1 will result in returning a shuffled version of the complete Dataset.\nSetting random_state=seed will result in the same randomization as used in the course resources.\ndf_shuffled = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=seed)\ndf_shuffled.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\nAdded by Sylvia Schmitt", "section": "2.
