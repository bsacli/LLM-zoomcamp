{"text": "It\u2019s possible that when you follow the videos, you\u2019ll get a Singular Matrix error. We will explain why it happens in the Regularization video. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s normal that you have it.\nYou can also have an error because you did the inverse of X once in your code and you\u2019re doing it a second time.\n(Added by C\u00e9cile Guillot)", "section": "2.
