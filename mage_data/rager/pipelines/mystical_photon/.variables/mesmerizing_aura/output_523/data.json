{"text": "The error message \u201ccould not convert string to float: \u2018Nissan\u2019\u201d typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand \u2018Nissan\u2019 into a numerical value, which isn\u2019t possible.\nTo resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:\nimport pandas as pd\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands\ndata_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])\nIn this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the \u2018brand\u2019 column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., \u2018brand_Nissan\u2019, \u2018brand_Toyota\u2019, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.\n-Mohammad Emad Sharifi-", "section": "3.
