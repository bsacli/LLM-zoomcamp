{"text": "For churn/not churn predictions, I need help to interpret the following scenario please, what is happening when:\nThe threshold is 1.0\nFPR is 0.0\nAnd TPR is 0.0\nWhen the threshold is 1.0, the condition for belonging to the positive class (churn class) is g(x)>=1.0 But g(x) is a sigmoid function for a binary classification problem. It has values between 0 and 1. This function  never becomes equal to outermost values, i.e. 0 and 1.\nThat is why there is no object, for which churn-condition could be satisfied. And that is why there is no any positive  (churn) predicted value (neither true positive, nor false positive), if threshold is equal to 1.0\nAlena Kniazeva", "section": "4.
