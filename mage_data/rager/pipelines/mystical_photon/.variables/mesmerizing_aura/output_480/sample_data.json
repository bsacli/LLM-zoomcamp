{"text": "Note, that matrix multiplication (matrix-matrix, matrix-vector multiplication) can be written as * operator in some sources, but performed as @ operator or np.matmul() via numpy. * operator performs element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product).\nnumpy.dot() or ndarray.dot() can be used, but for matrix-matrix multiplication @ or np.matmul() is preferred (as per numpy doc).\nIf multiplying by a scalar numpy.multiply() or * is preferred.\nAdded by Andrii Larkin", "section": "1.
