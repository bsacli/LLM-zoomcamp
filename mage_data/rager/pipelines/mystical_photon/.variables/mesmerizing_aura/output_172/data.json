{"text": "If you want to rune multiple docker containers from different directories. Then make sure to change the port mappings in the docker-compose.yml file.\nports:\n- 8088:6789\nThe 8088 port in above case is hostport, where mage will run on your local machine. You can customize this as long as the port is available. If you are running on VM, make sure to forward the port too. You need to keep the container port to 6789 as this is the port where mage is running.\nGCP - 2.2.7d Deploying Mage to Google Cloud\nWhile terraforming all the resources inside a VM created in GCS the following error is shown.\nError log:\nmodule.lb-http.google_compute_backend_service.default[\"default\"]: Creating...\n\u2577\n\u2502 Error: Error creating GlobalAddress: googleapi: Error 403: Request had insufficient authentication scopes.\n\u2502 Details:\n\u2502 [\n\u2502   {\n\u2502     \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo\",\n\u2502     \"domain\": \"googleapis.com\",\n\u2502     \"metadatas\": {\n\u2502       \"method\": \"compute.beta.GlobalAddressesService.Insert\",\n\u2502       \"service\": \"compute.googleapis.com\"\n\u2502     },\n\u2502     \"reason\": \"ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT\"\n\u2502   }\n\u2502 ]\n\u2502\n\u2502 More details:\n\u2502 Reason: insufficientPermissions, Message: Insufficient Permission\nThis error might happen when you are using a VM inside GCS. To use the Google APIs from a GCP virtual machine you need to add the cloud platform scope (\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\") to your VM when it is created.\nSince ours is already created you can just stop it and change the permissions. You can do it in the console, just go to \"EDIT\", g99o all the way down until you find \"Cloud API access scopes\". There you can \"Allow full access to all Cloud APIs\". I did this and all went smoothly generating all the resources needed. Hope it helps if you encounter this same error.\nResources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35928534/403-request-had-insufficient-authentication-scopes-during-gcloud-container-clu", "section": "Module 2: Workflow Orchestration", "question": "Ruuning Multiple Mage instances in Docker from different directories", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "997d4aaa"}
