{"text": "Pyspark converts the difference of two TimestampType values to Python's native datetime.timedelta object. The timedelta object only stores the duration in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. Each of the three units of time must be manually converted into hours in order to express the total duration between the two timestamps using only hours.\nAnother way for achieving this is using the datediff (sql function). It receives this parameters\nUpper Date: the closest date you have. For example dropoff_datetime\nLower Date: the farthest date you have.  For example pickup_datetime\nAnd the result is returned in terms of days, so you could multiply the result for 24 in order to get the hours.", "section": "Module 5: pyspark", "question": "Homework - how to convert the time difference of two timestamps to hours", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "f01df45b"}
