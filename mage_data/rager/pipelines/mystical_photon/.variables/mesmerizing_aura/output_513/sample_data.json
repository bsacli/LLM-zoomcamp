{"text": "Numpy and Pandas packages use different equations to compute the standard deviation. Numpy uses  population standard deviation, whereas pandas uses sample standard deviation by default.\nNumpy\nPandas\npandas default standard deviation is computed using one degree of freedom. You can change degree in of freedom in NumPy to change this to unbiased estimator by using ddof parameter:\nimport numpy as np\nnp.std(df.weight, ddof=1)\nThe result will be similar if we change the dof = 1 in numpy\n(Harish Balasundaram)", "section": "2.
