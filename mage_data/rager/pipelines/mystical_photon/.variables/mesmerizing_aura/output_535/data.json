{"text": "Ridge with sag solver requires feature to be of the same scale. You may get the following warning: ConvergenceWarning: The max_iter was reached which means the coef_ did not converge\nPlay with different scalers. See notebook-scaling-ohe.ipynb\nDmytro Durach\n(Oscar Garcia)  Use a StandardScaler for the numeric fields and OneHotEncoder (sparce = False) for the categorical features.  This help with the warning. Separate the features (num/cat) without using the encoder first and see if that helps.", "section": "3.
