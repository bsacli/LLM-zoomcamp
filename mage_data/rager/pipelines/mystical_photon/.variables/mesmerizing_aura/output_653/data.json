{"text": "When I run dt = DecisionTreeClassifier() in jupyter in same laptop, each time I re-run it or do (restart kernel + run) I get different values of auc. Some of them are 0.674, 0.652, 0.642, 0.669 and so on.  Anyone knows why it could be? I am referring to 7:40-7:45 of video 6.3.\nSolution: try setting the random seed e.g\ndt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=22)\nBhaskar Sarma", "section": "6.
