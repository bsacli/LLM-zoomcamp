Delete these datasets, and recreate them with your specified region and the correct naming format.\nAlternatively, instead of removing datasets, you can specify the single-region location you are using. E.g. instead of \u2018location: US\u2019, specify the region, so \u2018location: US-east1\u2019. See this Github comment for more detail. Additionally please see this post of Sandy\nIn DBT cloud you can actually specify the location using the following steps:\nGPo to your profile page (top right drop-down --> profile)\nThen go to under Credentials --> Analytics (you may have customised this name)\nClick on Bigquery >\nHit Edit\nUpdate your location, you may need to re-upload your service account JSON to re-fetch your private key, and save.
