{"text": "If you follow the video 1.2.2 - Ingesting NY Taxi Data to Postgres and you execute all the same\nsteps as Alexey does, you will ingest all the data (~1.3 million rows) into the table yellow_taxi_data as expected.\nHowever, if you try to run the whole script in the Jupyter notebook for a second time from top to bottom, you will be missing the first chunk of 100000 records. This is because there is a call to the iterator before the while loop that puts the data in the table. The while loop therefore starts by ingesting the second chunk, not the first.\n\u2705Solution: remove the cell \u201cdf=next(df_iter)\u201d that appears higher up in the notebook than the while loop. The first time w(df_iter) is called should be within the while loop.\n\ud83d\udcd4Note: As this notebook is just used as a way to test the code, it was not intended to be run top to bottom, and the logic is tidied up in a later step when it is instead inserted into a .py file for the pipeline", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "Python - Ingestion with Jupyter notebook - missing 100000 records", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "10acd478"}
