{"text": "Problem description. How can we use Jupyter notebooks with the Pipenv environment?\nSolution: Refer to this stackoverflow question. Basically install jupyter and ipykernel using pipenv. And then register the kernel with `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-virtualenv-name` inside the Pipenv shell. If you are using Jupyter notebooks in VS Code, doing this will also add the virtual environment in the list of kernels.\nAdded by Ron Medina", "section": "Module 4: Deployment", "question": "Pipenv with Jupyter", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "29b5651e"}
