{"text": "These both methods receive the dictionary as an input. While the DictVectorizer will store the big vocabulary and takes more memory. FeatureHasher create a vectors with predefined length. They are both used for categorical features.\nWhen you have a high cardinality for categorical features better to use FeatureHasher. If you want to preserve feature names in transformed data and have a small number of unique values is DictVectorizer. But your choice will dependence on your data.\nYou can read more by follow the link https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.html\nOlga Rudakova", "section": "3.
