{"text": "If you use Anaconda (recommended for the course), it comes with pip, so the issues is probably that the anaconda\u2019s Python is not on the PATH.\nAdding it to the PATH is different for each operation system.\nFor Linux and MacOS:\nOpen a terminal.\nFind the path to your Anaconda installation. This is typically `~/anaconda3` or `~/opt/anaconda3`.\nAdd Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=\"/path/to/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"`.\nTo make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (MacOS) file.\nOn Windows, python and pip are in different locations (python is in the anaconda root, and pip is in Scripts). With GitBash:\nLocate your Anaconda installation. The default path is usually `C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Anaconda3`.\nDetermine the correct path format for Git Bash. Paths in Git Bash follow the Unix-style, so convert the Windows path to a Unix-style path. For example, `C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Anaconda3` becomes `/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3`.\nAdd Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=\"/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/:/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/Scripts/$PATH\"`.\nTo make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.\nRefresh your environment with the command: `source ~/.bashrc`.\nFor Windows (without Git Bash):\nRight-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.\nClick on 'Advanced system settings'.\nIn the System Properties window, click on 'Environment Variables'.\nIn the Environment Variables window, select the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section and click 'Edit'.\nIn the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and add the path to your Anaconda installation (typically `C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Anaconda3` and C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Anaconda3\\Scripts`).\nClick 'OK' in all windows to apply the changes.\nAfter adding Anaconda to the PATH, you should be able to use `pip` from the command line. Remember to restart your terminal (or command prompt in Windows) to apply these changes.", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "1cd746c4"}
