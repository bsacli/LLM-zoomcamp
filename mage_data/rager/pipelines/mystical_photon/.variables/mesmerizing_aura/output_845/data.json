{"text": "Problem: My LinearRegression RSME is very close to the answer but not exactly the same. Is this normal?\nAnswer: No, LinearRegression is an deterministic model, it should always output the same results when given the same inputs.\nAnswer:\nCheck if you have treated the outlier properly for both train and validation sets\nCheck if the one hot encoding has been done properly by looking at the shape of one hot encoded feature matrix. If it shows 2 features, there is wrong with one hot encoding. Hint: the drop off and pick up codes need to be converted to proper data format and then DictVectorizer is fitted.\nHarshit Lamba (hlamba19@gmail.com)", "section": "Module 1: Introduction", "question": "Slightly different RSME", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "4aa8eafc"}
