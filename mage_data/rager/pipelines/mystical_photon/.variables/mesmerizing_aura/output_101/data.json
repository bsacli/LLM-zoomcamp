To mitigate this, use a different port, like 5431, when creating the docker container, as in: -p 5431: 5432\nThen, we need to use this port when connecting to pgcli, as shown below:\npgcli -h localhost -p 5431 -u root -d ny_taxi\nThis will connect you to your postgres docker container, which is mapped to your host\u2019s 5431 port (though you might choose any port of your liking as long as it is not occupied).\nFor a more visual and detailed explanation, feel free to check the video 1.4.2 - Port Mapping and Networks in Docker\nIf you want to debug: the following can help (on a MacOS)\nTo find out if something is blocking your port (on a MacOS):\nYou can use the lsof command to find out which application is using a specific port on your local machine. `lsof -i :5432`wi\nOr list the running postgres services on your local machine with launchctl\nTo unload the running service on your local machine (on a MacOS):\nunload the launch agent for the PostgreSQL service, which will stop the service and free up the port  \n`launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`\nthis one to start it again\n`launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`\nChanging port from 5432:5432 to 5431:5432 helped me to avoid this error.", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "PGCLI - FATAL: password authentication failed for user \"root\" (You already have Postgres)", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "3e5d1e9b"}
