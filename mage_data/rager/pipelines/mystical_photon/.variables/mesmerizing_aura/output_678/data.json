{"text": "Problem:\nWhen resuming training after augmentation, the loss skyrockets (1000+ during first epoch) and accuracy settles around 0.5 \u2013 i.e. the model becomes as good as a random coin flip.\nSolution:\nCheck that the augmented ImageDataGenerator still includes the option \u201crescale\u201d as specified in the preceding step.\nAdded by Konrad M\u00fchlberg", "section": "8.
