You can either increase the base EBS volume by following this link or add an external disk to your instance and configure conda installation to happen on the external disk.\nAbinaya Mahendiran\nOn GCP: I added another disk to my vm and followed this guide to mount the disk. Confirm the mount by running df -H (disk free) command in bash shell. I also deleted Anaconda and instead used miniconda. I downloaded miniconda in the additional disk that I mounted and when installing miniconda, enter the path to the extra disk instead of the default disk, this way conda is installed on the extra disk.\nYang Cao", "section": "Module 2: Experiment tracking", "question": "No Space Left on Device - OSError[Errno 28]", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "51c99586"}
