{"text": "Why should we transform the target variable to logarithm distribution? Do we do this for all machine learning projects?\nOnly if you see that your target is highly skewed. The easiest way to evaluate this is by plotting the distribution of the target variable.\nThis can help to understand skewness and how it can be applied to the distribution of your data set.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness\nPastor Soto", "section": "2.
