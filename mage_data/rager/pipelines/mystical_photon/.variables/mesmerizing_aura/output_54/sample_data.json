{"text": "Whenever a `docker pull is performed (either manually or by `docker-compose up`), it attempts to fetch the given image name (pgadmin4, for the example above) from a repository (dbpage).\nIF the repository is public, the fetch and download happens without any issue whatsoever.\nFor instance:\ndocker pull postgres:13\ndocker pull dpage/pgadmin4\nBE ADVISED:\n\nThe Docker Images we'll be using throughout the Data Engineering Zoomcamp are all public (except when or if explicitly said otherwise by the instructors or co-instructors).\n\nMeaning: you are NOT required to perform a docker login to fetch them. \n\nSo if you get the message above saying \"docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied. That is most likely due to a typo in your image name:\n\nFor instance:\n$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4\nWill throw that exception telling you \"repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'\nError response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or \nmay require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\nBut that actually happened because the actual image is dpage/pgadmin4 and NOT dbpage/pgadmin4\nHow to fix it:\n$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\nEXTRA NOTES:\nIn the real world, occasionally, when you're working for a company or closed organisation, the Docker image you're trying to fetch might be under a private repo that your DockerHub Username was granted access to.\nFor which cases, you must first execute:\n$ docker login\nFill in the details of your username and password.\nAnd only then perform the `docker pull` against that private repository\nWhy am I encountering a \"permission denied\" error when creating a PostgreSQL Docker container for the New York Taxi Database with a mounted volume on macOS M1?\nIssue Description:\nWhen attempting to run a Docker command similar to the one below:\ndocker run -it \\\n-e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\n-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\n-e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\n-v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\n-p 5432:5432 \\mount\npostgres:13\nYou encounter the error message:\ndocker: Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data': chown /path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data: permission denied.\nSolution:\n1- Stop Rancher Desktop:\nIf you are using Rancher Desktop and face this issue, stop Rancher Desktop to resolve compatibility problems.\n2- Install Docker Desktop:\nInstall Docker Desktop, ensuring that it is properly configured and has the required permissions.\n2-Retry Docker Command:\nRun the Docker command again after switching to Docker Desktop. This step resolves compatibility issues on some systems.\nNote: The issue occurred because Rancher Desktop was in use. Switching to Docker Desktop resolves compatibility problems and allows for the successful creation of PostgreSQL containers with mounted volumes for the New York Taxi Database on macOS M1.", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "Docker - docker pull dbpage", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "e866156b"}
