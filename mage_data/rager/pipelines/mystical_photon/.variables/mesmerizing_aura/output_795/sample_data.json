{"text": "When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.\nFor example:\nA (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)\nB (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)\nC and D are matrices of different sizes and usually have different values. Therefore the order is important in matrix multiplication and changing the order changes the result.\nBaran Ak\u0131n", "section": "Miscellaneous", "question": "About getting the wrong result when multiplying matrices", "course": "machine-learning-zoomcamp", "document_id": "59b4324f"}
