{"text": "ERROR: The Compose file './docker/docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:\nInvalid top-level property \"x-image\". Valid top-level sections for this Compose file are: version, services, networks, volumes, secrets, configs, and extensions starting with \"x-\".\nYou might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g \"2.2\" or \"3.3\") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.\nFor more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/\nIf you encounter the above error and have docker-compose installed, try updating your version of docker-compose. At the time of reporting this issue (March 17 2024), Ubuntu does not seem to support a docker-compose version high enough to run the required docker images. If you have this error and are on a Ubuntu machine, consider starting a VM with a Debian machine or look for an alternative way to download docker-compose at the latest version on your machine.", "section": "Workshop 2 - RisingWave", "question": "Setup - start-cluster error: Invalid top-level property x-image", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "9c750080"}
