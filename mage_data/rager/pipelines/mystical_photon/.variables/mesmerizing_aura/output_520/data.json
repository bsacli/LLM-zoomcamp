{"text": "The instruction for applying log transformation to the \u2018median_house_value\u2019 variable is provided before Q3 in the homework for Week-2 under the \u2018Prepare and split the dataset\u2019 heading.\nHowever, this instruction is absent in the subsequent questions of the homework, and I got stuck with Q5 for a long time, trying to figure out why my RMSE was so huge, when it clicked to me that I forgot to apply log transformation to the target variable. Please remember to apply log transformation to the target variable for each question.\n(Added by Soham Mundhada)", "section": "2.
