{"text": "When encountering convergence errors during the training of a Ridge regression model, consider the following steps:\nFeature Normalization: Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a \tsimilar scale, preventing convergence issues.\nCategorical Feature Encoding: If your dataset includes categorical features, apply \tcategorical encoding techniques such as OneHotEncoder (OHE) to \tconvert them into a numerical format. OHE is commonly used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge.\nCombine Features: After \tnormalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.\nBy following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.\nYou can find an example here.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOsman Ali", "section": "3.
