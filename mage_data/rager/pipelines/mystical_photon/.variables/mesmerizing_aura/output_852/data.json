{"text": "While working through the HW1, you will realize that the training and the validation data set feature sizes are different. I was trying to figure out why and went down the entire rabbit hole only to see that I wasn\u2019t doing ```transform``` on the premade dictionary vectorizer instead of ```fit_transform```. You already have the dictionary vectorizer made so no need to execute the fit pipeline on the model.\nSam Lim(changhyeonlim@gmail.com)", "section": "Module 1: Introduction", "question": "The feature size is different for training set and validation set", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "840f739d"}
