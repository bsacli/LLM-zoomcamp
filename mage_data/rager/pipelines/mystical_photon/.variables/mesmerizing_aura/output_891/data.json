{"text": "Problem: Someone asked why we are using this type of split approach instead of just a random split.\nSolution: For example, I have some models at work that train on Jan 1 2020 \u2014 Aug 1 2021 time period, and then test on Aug 1 - Dec 31 2021, and finally validate on Jan - March or something\nWe do these \u201cout of time\u201d  validations to do a few things:\nCheck for seasonality of our data\nWe know if the RMSE for Test is 5 say, and then RMSE for validation is 20, then there\u2019s serious seasonality to the data we are looking at, and now we might change to Time Series approaches\nIf I\u2019m predicting on Mar 30 2023 the outcomes for the next 3 months, the \u201crandom sample\u201d in our train/test would have caused data leakage, overfitting, and poor model performance in production. We mustn\u2019t take information about the future and apply it to the present when we are predicting in a model context.\nThese are two of, I think, the biggest points for why we are doing jan/feb/march. I wouldn\u2019t do it any other way.\nTrain: Jan\nTest: Feb\nValidate: March\nThe point of validation is to report out model metrics to leadership, regulators, auditors, and record the models performance to then later analyze target drift\nAdded by Sam LaFell\nProblem: If you get an error while trying to run the mlflow server on AWS CLI with S3 bucket and POSTGRES database:\nReproducible Command:\nmlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000 --backend-store-uri postgresql://<DB_USERNAME>:<DB_PASSWORD>@<DB_ENDPOINT>:<DB_PORT>/<DB_NAME> --default-artifact-root s3://<BUCKET_NAME>\nError:\n\"urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently \"\nImportError: urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips  26 Jan 2017'.
