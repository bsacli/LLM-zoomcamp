{"text": "(Question by Connie S.)\nThe reason it's good/recommended practice to do it after splitting is to avoid data leakage - you don't want any data from the test set influencing the training stage (similarly from the validation stage in the initial training). See e.g. scikit-learn documentation on \"Common pitfalls and recommended practices\": https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html\nAnswered/added by Rileen Sinha", "section": "3. Machine Learning for Classification", "question": "Isn't it easier to use DictVertorizer or get dummies before splitting the data into train/val/test? Is there a reason we wouldn't do this? Or is it the same either way?", "course": "machine-learning-zoomcamp", "document_id": "eb5a25cb"}
