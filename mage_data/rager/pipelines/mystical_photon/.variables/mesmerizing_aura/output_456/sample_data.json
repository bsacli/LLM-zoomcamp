{"text": "When you post about what you learned from the course on your social media pages, use the tag #mlzoomcamp. When you submit your homework, there\u2019s a section in the form for putting the links there. Separate multiple links by any whitespace character (linebreak, space, tab, etc).\nFor posting the learning in public links, you get extra scores. But the number of scores is limited to 7 points: if you put more than 7 links in your homework form, you\u2019ll get only 7 points.\nThe same content can be posted to 7 different social sites and still earn you 7 points if you add 7 URLs per week, see Alexey\u2019s reply. (~ ellacharmed)\nFor midterms/capstones, the awarded points are doubled as the duration is longer. So for projects the points are capped at 14 for 14 URLs.", "section": "General course-related questions", "question": "Submitting learning in public links", "course": "machine-learning-zoomcamp", "document_id": "f7bc2f65"}
