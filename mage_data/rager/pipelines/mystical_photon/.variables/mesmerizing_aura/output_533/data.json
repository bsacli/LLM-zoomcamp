{"text": "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity (when independent variables are highly correlated) and prevent overfitting in predictive modeling. It adds a regularization term to the linear regression cost function, penalizing large coefficients.\nsag Solver: The sag solver stands for \"Stochastic Average Gradient.\" It's particularly suitable for large datasets, as it optimizes the regularization term using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). sag can be faster than some other solvers for large datasets.\nAlpha: The alpha parameter  controls the strength of the regularization in Ridge regression. A higher alpha value leads to stronger regularization, which means the model will have smaller coefficient values, reducing the risk of overfitting.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nridge = Ridge(alpha=alpha, solver='sag', random_state=42)\nridge.fit(X_train, y_train)\nAminat Abolade", "section": "3.
