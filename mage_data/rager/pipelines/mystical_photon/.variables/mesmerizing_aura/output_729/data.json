{"text": "Running a CNN on your CPU can take a long time and once you\u2019ve run out of free time on some cloud providers, it\u2019s time to pay up. Both can be tackled by installing tensorflow with CUDA support on your local machine if you have the right hardware.\nI was able to get it working by using the following resources:\nCUDA on WSL :: CUDA Toolkit Documentation (nvidia.com)\nInstall TensorFlow with pip\nStart Locally | PyTorch\nI included the link to PyTorch so that you can get that one installed and working too while everything is fresh on your mind. Just select your options, and for Computer Platform, I chose CUDA 11.7 and it worked for me.\nAdded by Martin Uribe", "section": "10.
