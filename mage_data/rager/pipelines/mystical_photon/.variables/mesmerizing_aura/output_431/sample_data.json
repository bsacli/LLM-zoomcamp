{"text": "Example Error:\nWhen attempting to execute a Python script named seed-kafka.py or server.py with the following shebang line specifying Python 3 as the interpreter:\nUsers may encounter the following error in a Unix-like environment:\nThis error indicates that there is a problem with the Python interpreter path specified in the shebang line. The presence of the \\r character suggests that the script was edited or created in a Windows environment, causing the interpreter path to be incorrect when executed in Unix-like environments.\n2 Solutions:\nEither one or the other\nUpdate Shebang Line:\nVerify Python Interpreter Path: Use the which python3 command to determine the path to the Python 3 interpreter available in the current environment.\nUpdate Shebang Line: Open the script file in a text editor. Modify the shebang line to point to the correct Python interpreter path found in the previous step. Ensure that the shebang line is consistent with the Python interpreter path in the execution environment.\nExample Shebang Line:\nReplace /usr/bin/env python3 with the correct Python interpreter path found using which python3.\nConvert Line Endings:\nUse the dos2unix command-line tool to convert the line endings of the script from Windows-style to Unix-style.\nThis removes the extraneous carriage return characters (\\r), resolving issues related to unexpected tokens and ensuring compatibility with Unix-like environments.\nExample Command:", "section": "Workshop 2 - RisingWave", "question": "Resolving Python Interpreter Path Inconsistencies in Unix-like Environments", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "d452b490"}
