The data should live in BigQuery.  The dataset location is EU.  However, when I am running the model in production, a prod dataset is being create in BigQuery with a location US and the dbt invoke build is failing giving me \"ERROR 404: porject.dataset:prod not available in location EU\". I tried different ways to fix this. I am not sure if there is a more simple solution then creating my project or buckets in location US. Hope anyone can help here.\nNote: Everything is working fine in development mode, the issue is just happening when scheduling and running job in production\nSolution: I created the prod dataset manually in BQ and specified EU, then I ran the job.", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "If you are getting not found in location us error.", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "1f519b1a"}
