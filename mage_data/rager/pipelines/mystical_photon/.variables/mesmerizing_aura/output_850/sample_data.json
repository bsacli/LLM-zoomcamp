{"text": "Problem: The output of DictVectorizer was taking up too much memory. So much so, that I couldn\u2019t even fit the linear regression model before running out of memory on my 16 GB machine.\nSolution: In the example for DictVectorizer in the scikit-learn website, they set the parameter \u201csparse\u201d as False. Although this helps with viewing the results, this results in a lot of memory usage. The solution is to either use \u201csparse=True\u201d instead, or leave it at the default which is also True.\nAhmed Fahim (afahim03@yahoo.com)", "section": "Module 1: Introduction", "question": "Running out of memory", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "34bcad27"}
