This is caused by the pandas version 2.0.0 which seems incompatible with Spark 3.3.2, so to fix it you have to downgrade pandas to 1.5.3 using the command pip install -U pandas==1.5.3\nAnother option is adding the following after importing pandas, if one does not want to downgrade pandas version (source) :\npd.DataFrame.iteritems = pd.DataFrame.items\nNote that this problem is solved with Spark versions from 3.4.1", "section": "Module 5: pyspark", "question": "AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'iteritems'", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "59e86b40"}
