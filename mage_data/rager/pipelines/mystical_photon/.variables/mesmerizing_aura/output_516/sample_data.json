{"text": "The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the primary metrics to evaluate the performance of a regression model. It calculates the average deviation between the model's predicted values and the actual observed values, offering insight into the model's ability to accurately forecast the target variable. To calculate RMSE score:\nLibraries needed\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nmse = mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values)\nrmse = np.sqrt(mse)\nprint(\"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\", rmse)\n(Aminat Abolade)", "section": "2.
