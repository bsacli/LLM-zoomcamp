{"text": "Problem: when injecting data to bigquery, you may face the type error. This is because pandas by default will parse integer columns with missing value as float type.\nSolution:\nOne way to solve this problem is to specify/ cast data type Int64 during the data transformation stage.\nHowever, you may be lazy to type all the int columns. If that is the case, you can simply use convert_dtypes to infer the data type\n# Make pandas to infer correct data type (as pandas parse int with missing as float)\ndf.fillna(-999999, inplace=True)\ndf = df.convert_dtypes()\ndf = df.replace(-999999, None)", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "How to automatically infer the column data type (pandas missing value issues)?", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "b087fa95"}
