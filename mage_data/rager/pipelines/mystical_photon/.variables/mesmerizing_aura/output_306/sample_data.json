{"text": "Issue: If you\u2019re having problems loading the FHV_20?? data from the github repo into GCS and then into BQ (input file not of type parquet), you need to do two things. First, append the URL Template link with \u2018?raw=true\u2019 like so:\nURL_TEMPLATE = URL_PREFIX + \"/fhv_tripdata_{{ execution_date.strftime(\\'%Y-%m\\') }}.parquet?raw=true\"\nSecond, update make sure the URL_PREFIX is set to the following value:\n\nURL_PREFIX = \"https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/blob/master/nyc-tlc/fhv\"\nIt is critical that you use this link with the keyword blob. If your link has \u2018tree\u2019 here, replace it. Everything else can stay the same, including the curl -sSLf command. \u2018", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "Homework - Ingesting FHV_20?? data", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "1e6b7da1"}
