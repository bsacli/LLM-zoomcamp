{"text": "Problem:\nWhen we run train_gen.flow_from_directory() as in video 8.5, it finds images belonging to 10 classes. Does it understand the names of classes from the names of folders? Or, there is already something going on deep behind?\nSolution:\nThe name of class is the folder name\nIf you just create some random folder with the name \"xyz\", it will also be considered as a class!! The name itself is saying flow_from_directory\na clear explanation below:\nhttps://vijayabhaskar96.medium.com/tutorial-image-classification-with-keras-flow-from-directory-and-generators-95f75ebe5720\nAdded by Bhaskar Sarma", "section": "8.
