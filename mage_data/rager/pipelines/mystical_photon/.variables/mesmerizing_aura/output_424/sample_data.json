Without this the it fails to install pyproject.toml-based projects\n\u201cIt's possible that in your specific environment, the gcc installation was required at the system level rather than within the virtual environment. This can happen if the build process for psycopg2 tries to access system-level dependencies during installation.\nInstalling gcc in your main Python installation (Conda) would make it available system-wide, allowing any Python environment to access it when necessary for building packages.\u201d\ngcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is a compiler system developed by the GNU Project that supports various programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, and Fortran.\nGCC is widely used for compiling source code written in these languages into executable programs or libraries. It's a key tool in the software development process, particularly in the compilation stage where source code is translated into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor.\nIn addition to compiling source code, GCC also provides various optimization options, debugging support, and extensive documentation, making it a powerful and versatile tool for developers across different platforms and architectures.\n\u2014-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "section": "Workshop 2 - RisingWave", "question": "Psycopg2 - `Could not build wheels for psycopg2, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects`", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "94fd2476"}
