{"text": "Problem description\nWhen I run the command \u201cdocker-compose up \u2013build\u201d and send the data to the real-time prediction service. The service will return \u201cMax retries exceeded with url: /api\u201d.\nIn my case it because of my evidently service exit with code 2 due to the \u201capp.py\u201d in evidently service cannot import \u201cfrom pyarrow import parquet as pq\u201d.\nSolution description\nThe first solution is just install the pyarrow module \u201cpip install pyarrow\u201d\nThe second solution is restart your machine.\nThe third solution is if the first and second one didn\u2019t work with your machine. I found that \u201capp.py\u201d of evidently service didn\u2019t use that module. So comment the pyarrow module out and the problem was solved for me.\nAdded by Surawut Jirasaktavee", "section": "Module 5: Monitoring", "question": "Evidently service exit with code 2", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "d828de2a"}
