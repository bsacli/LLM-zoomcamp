{"text": "The command to read folders in the dataset in the tensorflow source code is:\nfor subdir in sorted(os.listdir(directory)):\n\u2026\nReference: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py, line 563\nThis means folders will be read in alphabetical order. For example, in the case of a folder named dino, and another named dragon, dino will read first and will have class label 0, whereas dragon will be read in next and will have class label 1.\nWhen a Keras model predicts binary labels, it will only return one value, and this is the probability of class 1 in case of sigmoid activation function in the last dense layer with 2 neurons. The probability of class 0 can be found out by:\nprob(class(0)) = 1- prob(class(1))\nIn case of using from_logits to get results, you will get two values for each of the labels.\nA prediction of 0.8 is saying the probability that the image has class label 1 (in this case dragon), is 0.8, and conversely we can infer the probability that the image has class label 0 is 0.2.\n(Added by Memoona Tahira)", "section": "8.
