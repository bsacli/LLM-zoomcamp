{"text": "In Kubernetes resource specifications, such as CPU requests and limits, the \"m\" stands for milliCPU, which is a unit of computing power. It represents one thousandth of a CPU core.\ncpu: \"100m\" means the container is requesting 100 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.1 CPU core.\ncpu: \"500m\" means the container has a CPU limit of 500 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.5 CPU core.\nThese values are specified in milliCPUs to allow fine-grained control over CPU resources. It allows you to express CPU requirements and limits in a more granular way, especially in scenarios where your application might not need a full CPU core.\nAdded by Andrii Larkin", "section": "10.
