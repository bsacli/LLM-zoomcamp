{"text": "Check if you specified if_exists argument correctly when writing data from GCS to BigQuery. When I wrote my automated flow for each month of the years 2019 and 2020 for green and yellow data I had specified if_exists=\"replace\" while I was experimenting with the flow setup. Once you want to run the flow for all months in 2019 and 2020 make sure to set if_exists=\"append\"\nif_exists=\"replace\" will replace the whole table with only the month data that you are writing into BigQuery in that one iteration -> you end up with only one month in BigQuery (the last one you inserted)\nif_exists=\"append\" will append the new monthly data -> you end up with data from all months", "section": "Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt", "question": "Build - Why do my fact_trips only contain one month of data?", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "de426d2f"}
