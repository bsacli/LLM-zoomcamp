{"text": "If anyone is troubleshooting or just interested in seeing the model listed on the image svizor/zoomcamp-model:mlops-3.10.0-slim.\nCreate a dockerfile. (yep thats all) and build \u201cdocker build -t zoomcamp_test .\u201d\nFROM svizor/zoomcamp-model:mlops-3.10.0-slim\nRun \u201cdocker run -it zoomcamp_test ls /app\u201d output -> model.bin\nThis will list the contents of the app directory and \u201cmodel.bin\u201d should output. With this you could just copy your files, for example \u201ccopy myfile .\u201d maybe a requirements file and this can be run for example \u201cdocker run -it myimage myscript arg1 arg2 \u201d. Of course keep in mind a build is needed everytime you change the Dockerfile.\nAnother variation is to have it run when you run the docker file.\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\nFROM svizor/zoomcamp-model:mlops-3.10.0-slim\nWORKDIR /app\nCMD ls\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\nJust keep in mind CMD is needed because the RUN commands are used for building the image and the CMD is used at container runtime. And in your example you probably want to run a script or should we say CMD a script.\nQuinn Avila", "section": "Module 4: Deployment", "question": "How to see the model in the docker container in app/?", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "047baefe"}
