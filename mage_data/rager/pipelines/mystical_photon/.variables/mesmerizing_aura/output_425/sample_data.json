{"text": "Below I have listed some steps I took to rectify this and potentially other minor errors, in Windows:\nUse the git bash terminal in windows.\nActivate python venv from git bash: source .venv/Scripts/activate\nModify the seed_kafka.py file: in the first line, replace python3 with python.\nNow from git bash, run the seed-kafka cmd. It should work now.\nAdditional Notes:\nYou can connect to the RisingWave cluster from Powershell with the command psql -h localhost -p 4566 -d dev -U root , otherwise it asks for a password.\nThe equivalent of source commands.sh  in Powershell is . .\\commands.sh from the workshop directory.\nHope this can save you from some trouble in case you're doing this workshop on Windows like I am.\n\u2014--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "section": "Workshop 2 - RisingWave", "question": "Psycopg2 InternalError: Failed to run the query - when running the seed-kafka command after initial setup.", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "70d83d78"}
