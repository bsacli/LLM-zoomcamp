{"text": "The evaluation RMSE I get doesn\u2019t figure within the options!\nIf you\u2019re evaluating the model on the entire February data, try to filter outliers using the same technique you used on the train data (0\u2264duration\u226460) and you\u2019ll get a RMSE which is (approximately) in the options. Also don\u2019t forget to convert the columns data types to str before using the DictVectorizer.\nAnother option: Along with filtering outliers, additionally filter on null values by replacing them with -1.  You will get a RMSE which is (almost same as) in the options. Use \u2018.round(2)\u2019 method to round it to 2 decimal points.\nWarning deprecation\nThe python interpreter warning of modules that have been deprecated  and will be removed in future releases as well as making suggestion how to go about your code.\nFor example\nC:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\seaborn\\distributions.py:2619:\nFutureWarning: `distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in a future version.
