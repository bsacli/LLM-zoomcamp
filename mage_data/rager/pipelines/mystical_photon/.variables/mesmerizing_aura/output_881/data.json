{"text": "Problem: After starting the tracking server, when we try to use the mlflow cli commands as listed here, most of them can\u2019t seem to find the experiments that have been run with the tracking server\nSolution: We need to set the environment variable MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI to the URI of the sqlite database. This is something like \u201cexport MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///{path to sqlite database}\u201d . After this, we can view the experiments from the command line using commands like \u201cmlflow experiments search\u201d\nEven after this commands like \u201cmlflow gc\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to get the tracking uri, and they have to be passed explicitly as an argument every time the command is run.\nAhmed Fahim (afahim03@yahoo.com)", "section": "Module 2: Experiment tracking", "question": "Viewing MLflow Experiments using MLflow CLI", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "af887c59"}
