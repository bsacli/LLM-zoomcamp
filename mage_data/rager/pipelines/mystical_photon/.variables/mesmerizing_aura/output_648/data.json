{"text": "I wanted to directly capture the output from the xgboost training for multiple eta values to a dictionary without the need to run the same cell multiple times and manually editing the eta value in between or copy the code for a second eta value.\nUsing the magic cell command \u201c%%capture output\u201d I was only able to capture the complete output for all iterations for the loop, but. I was able to solve this using the following approach. This is just a code sample to grasp the idea.\n# This would be the content of the Jupyter Notebook cell\nfrom IPython.utils.capture import capture_output\nimport sys\ndifferent_outputs = {}\nfor i in range(3):\nwith capture_output(sys.stdout) as output:\nprint(i)\nprint(\"testing capture\")\ndifferent_outputs[i] = output.stdout\n# different_outputs\n# {0: '0\\ntesting capture\\n',\n#  1: '1\\ntesting capture\\n',\n#  2: '2\\ntesting capture\\n'}\nAdded by Sylvia Schmitt", "section": "6.
