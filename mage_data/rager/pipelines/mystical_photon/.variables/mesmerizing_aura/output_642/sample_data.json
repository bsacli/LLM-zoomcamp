{"text": "In question 6, I was getting ValueError: feature_names must be string, and may not contain [, ] or < when I was creating DMatrix for train and validation\nSolution description\nThe cause of this error is that some of the features names contain special characters like = and <, and I fixed the error by removing them as  follows:\nfeatures= [i.replace(\"=<\", \"_\").replace(\"=\",\"_\") for i in features]\nAsia Saeed\nAlternative Solution:\nIn my case the equal sign \u201c=\u201d was not a problem, so in my opinion the first part of Asias solution features= [i.replace(\"=<\", \"_\") should work as well.\nFor me this works:\nfeatures = []\nfor f in dv.feature_names_:\nstring = f.replace(\u201c=<\u201d, \u201c-le\u201d)\nfeatures.append(string)\nPeter Ernicke", "section": "6.
