{"text": "One main reason behind that, is the way of splitting data. For example, we want to split data into train/validation/test with the ratios 60%/20%/20% respectively.\nAlthough the following two options end up with the same ratio, the data itself is a bit different and not 100% matching in each case.\n1)\ndf_train, df_temp = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)\ndf_val, df_test = train_test_split(df_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)\n2)\ndf_full_train, df_test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\ndf_train, df_val = train_test_split(df_full_train, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)\nTherefore, I would recommend using the second method which is more consistent with the lessons and thus the homeworks.\nIbraheem Taha", "section": "4.
