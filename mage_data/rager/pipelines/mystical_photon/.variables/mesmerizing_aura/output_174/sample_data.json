It is normal, so don\u2019t interrupt the process or think it\u2019s taking too long. If you have, make sure you run a terraform destroy before trying again as you will have likely partially created resources which will cause errors next time you run `terraform apply`.\n`terraform destroy` may not completely delete partial resources - go to Google Cloud Console and use the search bar at the top to search for the \u2018app.name\u2019 you declared in your variables.tf file; this will list all resources with that name - make sure you delete them all before running `terraform apply` again.\nWhy are my GCP free credits going so fast?
