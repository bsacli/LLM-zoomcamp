{"text": "In this video, we store the data file as \u201coutput.csv\u201d. The data file won\u2019t store correctly if the file extension is csv.gz instead of csv. One alternative is to replace csv_name = \u201coutput.cs -v\u201d with the file name given at the end of the URL. Notice that the URL for the yellow taxi data is: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz where the highlighted part is the name of the file. We can parse this file name from the URL and use it as csv_name. That is, we can replace csv_name = \u201coutput.csv\u201d with\ncsv_name = url.split(\u201c/\u201d)[-1] . Then when we use csv_name to using pd.read_csv, there won\u2019t be an issue even though the file name really has the extension csv.gz instead of csv since the pandas read_csv function can read csv.gz files directly.", "section": "Module 1: Docker and Terraform", "question": "Taxi Data - How to handle taxi data files, now that the files are available as *.csv.gz?", "course": "data-engineering-zoomcamp", "document_id": "71c10610"}
