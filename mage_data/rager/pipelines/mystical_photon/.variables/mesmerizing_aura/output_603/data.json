E.g. If you run any pipenv command in folder path ~/home/user/Churn-Flask-app, it will create an environment named Churn-Flask-app-some_random_characters, and it's path will be like this: /home/user/.local/share/virtualenvs/churn-flask-app-i_mzGMjX.\nAll libraries of this environment will be installed inside this folder. To activate this environment, I will need to cd into the project folder again, and type pipenv shell. In short, the location of the project folder acts as an identifier for an environment, in place of any name.\n(Memoona Tahira)", "section": "5.
