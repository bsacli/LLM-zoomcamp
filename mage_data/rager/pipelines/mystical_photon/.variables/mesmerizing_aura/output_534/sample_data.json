{"text": "DictVectorizer(sparse=True) produces CSR format, which is both more memory efficient and converges better during fit(). Basically it stores non-zero values and indices instead of adding a column for each class of each feature (models of cars produced 900+ columns alone in the current task).\nUsing \u201csparse\u201d format like on the picture above, both via pandas.get_dummies() and DictVectorizer(sparse=False) - is slower (around 6-8min for Q6 task - Linear/Ridge Regression) for high amount of classes (like models of cars for eg) and gives a bit \u201cworse\u201d results in both Logistic and Linear/Ridge Regression, while also producing convergence warnings for Linear/Ridge Regression.\nLarkin Andrii", "section": "3.
