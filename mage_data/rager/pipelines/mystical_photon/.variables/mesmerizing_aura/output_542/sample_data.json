{"text": "Both work in similar ways. That is, to convert categorical features to numerical variables for use in training the model. But the difference lies in the input. OneHotEncoder uses an array as input while DictVectorizer uses a dictionary.\nBoth will produce the same result. But when we use OneHotEncoder, features are sorted alphabetically. When you use DictVectorizer you stack features that you want.\nTanya Mard", "section": "3.
