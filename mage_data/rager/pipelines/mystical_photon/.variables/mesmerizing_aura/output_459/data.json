{"text": "If you get \u201cwget is not recognized as an internal or external command\u201d, you need to install it.\nOn Ubuntu, run\nsudo apt-get install wget\nOn Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:\nchoco install wget\nOr you can download a binary from here and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)\nOn Mac, the easiest way to install wget is to use brew.\nBrew install wget\nAlternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using \u201cwget\u201d you\u2019ll need eeeto use\npython -m wget\nYou need to install it with pip first:\npip install wget\nAnd then in your python code, for example in your jupyter notebook, use:\nimport wget\nwget.download(\"URL\")\nThis should download whatever is at the URL in the same directory as your code.\n(Memoona Tahira)\nAlternatively, you can read a CSV file from a URL directly with pandas:\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(url)\nValid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file.\nIn some cases you might need to bypass https checks:\nimport ssl\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\nOr you can use the built-in Python functionality for downloading the files:\nimport urllib.request\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv\"\nurllib.request.urlretrieve(url, \"housing.csv\")\nUrllib.request.urlretrieve() is a standard Python library function available on all devices and platforms. URL requests and URL data retrieval are done with the urllib.request module.\nThe urlretrieve() function allows you to download files from URLs and save them locally. Python programs use it to download files from the internet.\nOn any Python-enabled device or platform, you can use the urllib.request.urlretrieve() function to download the file.\n(Mohammad Emad Sharifi)", "section": "1.
