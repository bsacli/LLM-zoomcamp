Once created, you just need to run \"conda activate ml-zoomcamp\" whenever you want to use it.\n(Added by Wesley Barreto)\nconda env export > environment.yml will also allow you to reproduce your existing environment in a YAML file.  You can then recreate it with conda env create -f environment.yml", "section": "1.
