{"text": "Problem: I\u2019m facing an extremely low RMSE score (eg: 4.3451e-6) - what shall I do?\nAnswer: Recheck your code to see if your model is learning the target prior to making the prediction. If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that\u2019s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn\u2019t contain any part of your y_train. The same stands for validation too.\nSnehangsu De (desnehangsu@gmail.com)", "section": "Module 1: Introduction", "question": "Extremely low RSME", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "a9daaab0"}
