{"text": "How do I read the dataset with Pandas in Windows?\nI used the code below but not working\ndf = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\username\\Downloads\\data.csv')\nUnlike Linux/Mac OS, Windows uses the backslash (\\) to navigate the files that cause the conflict with Python. The problem with using the backslash is that in Python, the '\\' has a purpose known as an escape sequence. Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings, for example, \"\\n\" to add a new line or \"\\t\" to add spaces, etc. To avoid the issue we just need to add \"r\" before the file path and Python will treat it as a literal string (not an escape sequence).\nHere\u2019s how we should be loading the file instead:\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'C:\\Users\\username\\Downloads\\data.csv')\n(Muhammad Awon)", "section": "1.
