{"text": "I was doing Question 7 from Week1 Homework and with step6: Invert XTX, I created the inverse. Now, an inverse when multiplied by the original matrix should return in an Identity matrix. But when I multiplied the inverse with the original matrix, it gave a matrix like this:\nInverse * Original:\n[[ 1.00000000e+00 -1.38777878e-16]\n[ 3.16968674e-13  1.00000000e+00]]\nSolution:\nIt's because floating point math doesn't work well on computers as shown here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken\n(Added by Wesley Barreto)", "section": "1.
