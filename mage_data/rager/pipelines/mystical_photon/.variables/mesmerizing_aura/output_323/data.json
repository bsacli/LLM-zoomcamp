{"text": "You need to look for the Py4J file and note the version of the filename. Once you know the version, you can update the export command accordingly, this is how you check yours:\n` ls ${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/ ` and then you add it in the export command, mine was:\nexport PYTHONPATH=\u201d${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/Py4J-0.10.9.5-src.zip:${PYTHONPATH}\u201d\nMake sure that the version under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` matches the filename of py4j or you will encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j'` while executing `import pyspark`.\nFor instance, if the file under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` was `py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip`.\nThen the export PYTHONPATH statement above should be changed to `export PYTHONPATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH\"` appropriately.\nAdditionally, you can check for the version of \u2018py4j\u2019 of the spark you\u2019re using from here and update as mentioned above.\n~ Abhijit Chakraborty: Sometimes, even with adding the correct version of py4j might not solve the problem.
