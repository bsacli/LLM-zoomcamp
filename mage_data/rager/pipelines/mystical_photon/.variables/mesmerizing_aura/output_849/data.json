{"text": "Problem: PyCharm (remote) doesn\u2019t see conda execution path. So, I cannot use conda env (which is located on a remote server).\nSolution: In remote server in command line write \u201cconda activate envname\u201d, after write \u201cwhich python\u201d - it gives you python execution path. After you can use this path when you will add new interpreter in PyCharm: add local interpreter -> system interpreter -> and put the path with python.\nSalimov Ilnaz (salimovilnaz777@gmail.com)", "section": "Module 1: Introduction", "question": "Using PyCharm & Conda env in remote development", "course": "mlops-zoomcamp", "document_id": "4e08c86a"}
