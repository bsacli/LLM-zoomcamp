{"text": "I had this error when running the command line : interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, x) that can be seen in the video 9.3 around 12 minutes.\nValueError: Cannot set tensor: Got value of type UINT8 but expected type FLOAT32 for input 0, name: serving_default_conv2d_input:0\nThis is because the X is an int but a float is expected.\nSolution:\nI found this solution from this question here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76102508/valueerror-cannot-set-tensor-got-value-of-type-float64-but-expected-type-float :\n# Need to convert to float32 before set_tensor\nX = np.float32(X)\nThen, it works. I work with tensorflow 2.15.0, maybe the fact that this version is more recent involves this change ?\nAdded by M\u00e9lanie Fouesnard", "section": "9.
